# Who am I now

I am currently a software engineer working in Syndey Australia. 

# When to start coding

I stared programming when I was in high school. The first language I used is
Pascal, the first compiler I used was Borland Pascal compiler. I also join some
coding competition at that time.

# My career

I was working in a big telco equipment manufacturer when I started my career.

I switched to a silicon company which provide chips and solutions for
wireless/voice/IoT products. I am lucky to have different roles in this
company, as a software team leader/manager, and then as a technical sales and
account manager. The sales and AM roles were quite different with the pure
technical roles. That needs me to have much more complicated human to human
communications with a totally different set of skills, which I gained a lot
during the work.

A few years ago I switched to the technical roles again. But I still enjoyed the
work in roles which needs hybrid skill sets.
