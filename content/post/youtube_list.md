  Note the comments below the video are also informative.

>>     His repeated advice to refer to the manufacturer’s datasheets is very
>>     useful.  Manufacturers have done the hard work for you and provide you
>>     with proven designs. This is done to make their product easier to use
>>     and when their product is easier to use, you’re more likely to implement
>>     it into your design instead of something from one of their competitors.
>>     If you need to deviate or add to the design, you at least have a proven
>>     starting point. This also works in reverse, as well. Many times, over
>>     many years, I have been diagnosing circuits (especially, consumer grade
>>     equipment) where I didn’t have a schematic. I will often look up the
>>     datasheet for the IC in the section of the circuit which is
>>     malfunctioning. More times than not, the manufacturer copied the circuit
>>     right from the datasheet and you now have a schematic for that section.

>>     Really enjoy how Mike takes a difficult subject and makes it accessible!
>>     For example, the recent fomu provides an open source (verilog) usb stack

>>     Ultra low cost, Open USB Tools')
