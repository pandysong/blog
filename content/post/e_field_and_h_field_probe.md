# Introduction

How the different probe should be used:

# E-Field

E-Field is generated due to the voltage change. It is not related to the
direction of the probe.

# H-Field

H-Field  is generated due to the current change on the trace. It IS related to
the direction of the probe. By changing the direction of the probe, we could
know which trace causes the emission.

# Made your own probe

The video directly measure the amplitude of the H-Field. By using H-Field probe
and E-Field Probe together one could relate the voltage change to the E-Field
effects.
