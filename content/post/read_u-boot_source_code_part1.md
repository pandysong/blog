title: Read u-boot source code (part 1)

## Introduction

By utilizing the `make cscope` to create `cscope` database, I could browse a
specific build without being confused by a lot of symbols with same names.
This document describe very basic scenario on how to read the u-boot source
code.


## start.S

After loading the cscope.out, I could find search the starting point by the
following command

```
cs find f start.S
```

This leads me to the file `arm/cpu/arm1136/start.S`.



###  SVC32

SVC32 mode is the mode with highest privilege.

```
reset:
	/*
	 * set the cpu to SVC32 mode
	 */
	mrs	r0,cpsr
	bic	r0,r0,#0x1f
	orr	r0,r0,#0xd3
	msr	cpsr,r0
```

From the ARM11 specification,
http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0360f/DDI0360F_arm11_mpcore_r2p0_trm.pdf,
Section 2.9, we could learn that the register CPSR's bit 0 to bit 4 contains
the processor operating mode.

In Section 2.9.7, we learned that value `b10011` will set the processor to
supervisor mode.

`bic` (bit clear) clears the r0's bit 0 to bit 4. And `orr` instruction sets
the bit `0b11010011`, apart from setting the mode to SVC mode, it also disables
FIQ and IRQ.

### flash caches

```
cpu_init_crit:
	/*
	 * flush v4 I/D caches
	 */
	mov	r0, #0
	mcr	p15, 0, r0, c7, c7, 0	/* Invalidate I+D+BTB caches */
	mcr	p15, 0, r0, c8, c7, 0	/* Invalidate Unified TLB */
```

The first instruction about "Invalidate I+D+BTB caches" could be understood
from the following figure in "ARM11 MPCoreâ„¢ Processor Revision: r2p0 Technical
Reference Manual": ![arm-cache-operation](/img/arm-cache-operation.png)

The instruction about TLB could be understood from following figure:
![arm-invalidate-tlb](/img/arm-invalidate-tlb.png)

### disable MMU and data cache

```
	/*
	 * disable MMU stuff and caches
	 */
	mrc	p15, 0, r0, c1, c0, 0
	bic	r0, r0, #0x00002300	@ clear bits 13, 9:8 (--V- --RS)
	bic	r0, r0, #0x00000087	@ clear bits 7, 2:0 (B--- -CAM)
	orr	r0, r0, #0x00000002	@ set bit 1 (A) Align
	orr	r0, r0, #0x00001000	@ set bit 12 (I) I-Cache
	mcr	p15, 0, r0, c1, c0, 0

```

According to following figure:

![arm-read-write-register](/img/arm-read-write-register.png)

The code first reads the control register to `r0`, then modifies the value of
`r0` and writes it back to control register.

![arm-control-register-format](/img/arm-control-register-format.png)

Detailed description are in following figures. The code first clears following
bits:

- bit 13, which selects the low normal exception vectors which range is address range =
0x00000000-0x0000001C.
- bits 9:8 is the ROM protection and System protection.
- bit 7 is "Reserved", I am not sure why the code needs to clear the bit.
-  bit 2:0 which is C , data cache disabled; A, strict alignment fault checking
  disabled; M, MMU disabled.

The code set following bits:

- bit 1: strict alignment fault checking enabled
- bit 12:  instruction cache enabled

The instruction cache is enabled in the code which looks not aligned with the
comments "instruction cache enabled".
