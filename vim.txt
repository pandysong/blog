" - gf go to the file under cusor using gf command
" - ctrl-^ to go back to previous file
"  about is using Ctrl - ] to follow a tag, and Ctrl - o to go back.
"
"  For what it's worth, Ctrl - i goes forward again. So for example, you might
"  gg to the top of a document, hit Ctrl - o (bringing you back to where you
"   motions, and hit enter to run the command under cursor.
"   Incidentally, you can also access your search history using q/ or q?.
"
" - q/ to view history of / command
" :wa     write all changed files (save all changes), and keep working
" :xa     exit all (save all changes and close Vim)
" :qa     quit all (close Vim, but not if there are unsaved changes)
" :qa!    quit all (close Vim without saving—discard any changes)
